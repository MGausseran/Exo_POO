# Triolingo - PHP Translation Game

**Triolingo** is a small translation game developed in PHP to help me get familiar with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The project is hosted locally using Laragon, and can be launched through `index.html` within the Laragon environment.

## How the Game Works

The player starts by entering their name and is then prompted to guess up to 10 random English words selected from a list of over 100 words. A small margin of error is allowed—up to one incorrect letter per word—so that minor typos do not penalize the player's guesses.
